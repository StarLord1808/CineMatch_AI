# üé¨ Movie Recommendation Bot (IMDB-Driven)

> An AI-powered chatbot that recommends movies based on user prompts, built for integration into a streaming platform (e.g., Netflix-like).  
> Data is sourced from IMDb reviews (feature, critics, and users), processed into embeddings, and served through a conversational interface.

## Phase 1: Strategy & Architecture Planning

### 1. Defining User Interaction (Prompts)
Users can type natural-language prompts. The bot translates these into recommendations.  

**Prompt categories:**
- **Mood-Based:**  
  `"I want a movie that feels like a warm hug on a rainy day."`  
- **Vibe/Theme-Based:**  
  `"Recommend a movie with a shocking plot twist I'll never see coming."`  
- **Comparative:**  
  `"Find me something similar to Inception but with less action and more philosophy."`  
- **Specific Element-Based:**  
  `"I want a thriller with a strong female lead and a cat-and-mouse chase."`  
- **Abstract:**  
  `"Make me question reality."`

### 2. High-Level System Architecture
```
[IMDb.com] -> [Scraping Engine] -> [Raw Text Data (Reviews)]
[Raw Text Data] -> [Processing Engine] -> [Vector Database]
[User Prompt] -> [Chatbot Interface] -> [Recommendation Engine] -> [Vector DB]
[Recommendation Engine] -> [Ranked Movies] -> [Chatbot Interface] -> [User]
```

**Components:**
- **Scraping Engine** ‚Üí Gather data from IMDb  
- **Processing & Vectorization Engine** ‚Üí Clean + embed reviews  
- **Recommendation Engine** ‚Üí Match prompts with vectors  
- **Chatbot Interface** ‚Üí User interaction layer  

---

## Phase 2: Data Acquisition Strategy (The Scraping Plan)

**Tools:** Python + `BeautifulSoup4`, `Scrapy`, `Selenium`, `requests`  

**Ethics:**  
- Respect [`robots.txt`](https://www.imdb.com/robots.txt)  
- Add delays (`time.sleep()`)  
- Rotate user-agents  
- Use IMDb-API for metadata where possible  

**Data Targets:**  
- Movie Metadata: title, year, cast, genres, summary  
- Featured Reviews & Critic Reviews  
- Top-voted User Reviews (20‚Äì30 per film)  

**Bootstrapping the DB:**  
- Start with ~1,000‚Äì2,000 films (popular + niche)  
- Weekly incremental updates (new movies, refreshed reviews)  

---

## Phase 3: Data Processing & Vectorization

**Text Cleaning:**  
- Lowercase, strip punctuation/HTML  
- Remove stopwords  
- Lemmatization (`running` ‚Üí `run`)  

**Embedding Model:**  
- Pretrained Sentence Transformer (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)  
- Output = dense vector embedding (‚âà384 dimensions)  

**Workflow:**  
- Combine metadata + plot + reviews ‚Üí single corpus per movie  
- Pass through transformer ‚Üí movie embedding  
- Store in **Vector DB** (ChromaDB, Pinecone, Weaviate)  

---

## Phase 4: Recommendation Engine Logic

**Steps:**
1. **Prompt Vectorization** ‚Üí Convert user request into embedding  
2. **Similarity Search** ‚Üí Query vector DB (Cosine Similarity)  
3. **Re-Ranking:**  
   - Filter unavailable titles  
   - Boost recent releases (if neutral prompt)  
   - Enforce diversity across results  

---

## Phase 5: Chatbot Interface & Response Generation

**Frontend:** Web/app widget (React, Vue.js)  
**Backend:** Python (`FastAPI`, `Django`)  

**Response Style:**  
- Explain *why* a movie was chosen using review snippets  
- Not just lists‚Äîcontextual explanations  

**Example:**  
```
Prompt: "mind-bending thriller with amazing visuals"
Bot: "You might like Tenet (2020). 
Users describe it as a 'spectacular, puzzle-like experience' 
and 'visually stunning,' though some found the plot 'complex and hard to follow.'"
```  

---

## Phase 6: Deployment, Monitoring, and Iteration

**Deployment:** Docker + Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)  
**Monitoring:**  
- Log prompts + recs  
- Track CTR (click-through-rate)  

**Iteration:**  
- Use feedback (thumbs up/down)  
- Fine-tune embeddings  
- Improve re-ranking logic  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Mitigations

- **Scraping Legality** ‚Üí Respect rate limits, prefer official APIs  
- **Compute Costs** ‚Üí Start small, scale embeddings gradually  
- **Cold Start Problem** ‚Üí Use metadata + genre/director fallback for new movies  
- **Bias in Reviews** ‚Üí Acknowledge reviewer demographic bias and mitigate in re-ranking
